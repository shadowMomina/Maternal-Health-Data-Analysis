# 📊 Data Cleaning and Visualization with Python

This project demonstrates a complete workflow of **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization** using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.  
It provides a reusable framework for preparing raw datasets, exploring data insights, and generating meaningful visual reports.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation

The notebook performs general data cleaning tasks such as:
- Importing data from local files or cloud storage  
- Checking dataset shape, column names, and data types  
- Handling missing or duplicate values  
- Renaming and formatting columns for consistency  
- Filtering out irrelevant or invalid data entries  
- Converting data types (e.g., object → numeric/date)  
- Exporting the cleaned dataset for future analysis

## 📈 Data Visualization

The project uses **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create insightful plots for better understanding of the data, including:

- Histogram → distribution of numerical values  
- Bar Chart → category-wise comparisons  
- Line Chart → trends over time  
- Scatter Plot → relationship between variables  
- Box Plot → outlier detection  
- Correlation Heatmap → variable relationships  
- Pie Chart → category proportions  
- Pairplot → multi-variable relationships  

All generated figures are automatically saved for presentation or reporting.
